# Todo
[x] simple training for single training
[x] modify for batch and support padding
[x] save the best model based on bleu on dev
[] add beam search decoding in `decoder` step of the model
[x] initiate the decoder hidden states with last step of encoder hidden states
[] ignore padding in attention
[x] make decoder lstm bidirectional
[] write detail of the attention mechanism
[] visualize attention matrices
